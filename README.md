## About Stratego

The game faithfully adheres to the classic rules of the traditional Stratego board game. Upon launching the game, players are greeted with a welcoming home screen where they are prompted to enter their name before embarking on their strategic journey. With anticipation building, players initiate the quest for a worthy adversary by selecting the "Play" button.

Once two players are successfully matched, the pivotal "board setup" phase commences. Here, both participants are granted a precious two-minute window to meticulously arrange their pieces upon the board. A prominent timer prominently displayed at the top ensures that neither player squanders a moment of this critical preparation time.

As the countdown dwindles to its conclusion, the game seamlessly transitions into its turn-based phase, igniting the strategic battle in earnest. An intuitive indicator prominently positioned above the board meticulously guides players, ensuring clarity on whose turn commands the battlefield at any given moment.

Amidst the riveting gameplay, victory and defeat loom as possible outcomes, triggered by the culmination of strategic maneuvers adhering to the established rules. In either outcome, players are gracefully ushered to the culmination of their journey, where they are presented with distinct options: a triumphant "Victory" button or a gracious "Defeat" button. With a simple press, players are gracefully redirected back to the comforting embrace of the home screen, ready to embark on their next thrilling encounter.
