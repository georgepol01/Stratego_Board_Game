## About Stratego

The game follows all standard rules of classic Stratego board game. At the home screen the player has to enter his name and click "Play" button in order to search for an opponent. When 2 players match the game "board setup" phase starts and both players have 2 minutes to rearrange their pieces on the board. a timer is shown on the top. When the time ends the game starts on a turn based logic and each players makes his move on his turn, there's an indicator on top showing which player's turn is active. After the game evolves based on all the rules mentionted, if a winning/losing condition triggers we can see the end of game for both players, showing a button for each case "Win" or "Defeat" and by pressing it the player is redirected to the home screen.
